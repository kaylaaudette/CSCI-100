# Option D: Dictionaries

#See activity 20 (dictionaries)

# Option E: Statistics â€“ mean, median, mode, frequency distribution, correlation

# See activity 21 (Frequency distribution)
# See activity 23 (Correlation)
# Consider the list a=[1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 1, 2, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 3, 3, 1].

# Option F: Reading/writing to files
#See activity 23

for i in range(1, 101): #start at 1
    thingToWrite = str(i) + "\n" # makes i into string
    numberFile.write(thingToWrite) # i is a number but our function is a string
    # gives us numbers but not seperated so we add \n to make text go onto new line

# using a while loop for the next 100 numbers
nextNum = 101 #initilize to 101

    nextThingToWrite = str(nextNum) + "\n"

#Option G: Reading from internet

#Read (but do not download) the file from http://csweb.wooster.edu/hguarnera/cs100/assignments/rainfall.txt.
#Output the contents of the page to the terminal decoded in UTF-8 format.
import urllib.request

output = [line.decode("utf-8") for line in Table] #decoding every line in Table (gets rid of b)

print(output)

for item in output:
    print(item)
